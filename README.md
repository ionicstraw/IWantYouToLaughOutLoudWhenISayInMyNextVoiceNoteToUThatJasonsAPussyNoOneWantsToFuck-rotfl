# IWantYouToLaughOutLoudWhenISayInMyNextVoiceNoteToUThatJasonsAPussyNoOneWantsToFuck-rotfl

its therapeutic to come up with what i want to say, ill record it when i feel ready, it could be this week or next week, i really want to streamline it so it could be used legally too

its good to talk about things instead of writing about it, its just different

and the bonus is i get to make you laugh ðŸ˜‚

might end up being 2-3 hrs long

im going to discuss this in the voicenote but look at this piece of shit https://biodatamining.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13040-025-00462-9

who would write something like this, its LESS than a blog article, fking stupid waste of time, LLMs are absolutely not ready to write bioinformatics code, they make a lot of errors and it takes an incredibly experienced bioinfo programmer (like me) to understand a lot of stuff to take out of the produced output from the LLM, so since jason doesnt have training in bioinformatics etc. he just doesnt know shit but talks out of his ass and writes sub-mediocre nonsense that makes no sense, absolute garbage i dont know why it was even written like hes saying essentally its okay to produce bugs in CLINICAL ??? bioinformatics pipelines where its a difference of life or death for a patient, gtfo jason u fking nobody wanna loser

we should get a domain, like "DoesJasonEverKnowWhatHesTalkingAbout.com" and put our understanding and experience out there as a response to anything and everything hes ever produced, everything from PennAI that has bugs to this fking bullshit, all of his papers, his entire career -- i think we can have a lot of fun with this throughout our career and our lives

i think its so funny that the coauthor on that paper is from columbia, and i saw a picture with jason and andrea califano on twitter in like 2018 (bc i interviewed with him in 2017 and theres a possibility he reached out to jason and the same thing happened there as well bc they stopped responding to my emails), but i wonder how obsessed jason is with columbia bc he burned his bridges with you guys LOL fking LOSER


yoo it is so therapeutic to do this voicenote, these people are so utterly disgusting like as im writing along the day what happend and on their bullshit research, i dunno its just so disgusting the feelings i have about them, how much of waste of time they have been, im so glad i have u to listen to me so i can share it and make u laugh too, im just really streamlining everything i want to say, like i want it to be really good, so when i feel ready, maybe this week or next week, ill record it -- i just cant believe this is real that ppl be this pathetic to stalk a resigned employee, my talking about makes it real and that is the power of words and talking

fking trailer park TRASH

im know, im going to feel SO MUCH BETTER after i do this: explain EVERYTHING that happened, its like this weight is being removed off my shoulders bc its been set up to look like its my fault or your fault, but its not our fault, these are just psychopaths, its a freak accident. if my first job out of undergrad was at MSKCC I WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY successful there and etc, but thats not what happened, i ended up in a shithole, run by trailer park trash
