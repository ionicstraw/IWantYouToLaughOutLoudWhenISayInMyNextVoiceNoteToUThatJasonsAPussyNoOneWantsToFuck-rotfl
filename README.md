# IWantYouToLaughOutLoudWhenISayInMyNextVoiceNoteToUThatJasonsAPussyNoOneWantsToFuck-rotfl

its therapeutic to come up with what i want to say, ill record it when i feel ready, it could be this week or next week, i really want to streamline it so it could be used legally too

its good to talk about things instead of writing about it, its just different

and the bonus is i get to make you laugh ðŸ˜‚

might end up being 2-3 hrs long

im going to discuss this in the voicenote but look at this piece of shit https://biodatamining.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13040-025-00462-9

who would write something like this, its LESS than a blog article, fking stupid waste of time, LLMs are absolutely not ready to write bioinformatics code, they make a lot of errors and it takes an incredibly experienced bioinfo programmer (like me) to understand a lot of stuff to take out of the produced output from the LLM, so since jason doesnt have training in bioinformatics etc. he just doesnt know shit but talks out of his ass and writes sub-mediocre nonsense that makes no sense, absolute garbage i dont know why it was even written like hes saying essentally its okay to produce bugs in CLINICAL ??? bioinformatics pipelines where its a difference of life or death for a patient, gtfo jason u fking nobody wanna loser
