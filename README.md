![img](how-i-feel-writing-my-notes-for-this-future-voicenote.png)

its therapeutic to come up with what i want to say, ill record it when i feel ready, it could be this week or next week, i really want to streamline it so it could be used legally too

its good to talk about things instead of writing about it, its just different

and the bonus is i get to make you laugh ðŸ˜‚

might end up being 2-3 hrs long

im going to discuss this in the voicenote but look at this piece of shit https://biodatamining.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13040-025-00462-9

who would write something like this, its LESS than a blog article, fking stupid waste of time, LLMs are absolutely not ready to write bioinformatics code, they make a lot of errors and it takes an incredibly experienced bioinfo programmer (like me) to understand a lot of stuff to take out of the produced output from the LLM, so since jason doesnt have training in bioinformatics etc. he just doesnt know shit but talks out of his ass and writes sub-mediocre nonsense that makes no sense, absolute garbage i dont know why it was even written like hes saying essentally its okay to produce bugs in CLINICAL ??? bioinformatics pipelines where its a difference of life or death for a patient, gtfo jason u fking nobody wanna loser

we should get a domain, like "DoesJasonEverKnowWhatHesTalkingAbout.com" and put our understanding and experience out there as a response to anything and everything hes ever produced, everything from PennAI that has bugs to this fking bullshit, all of his papers, his entire career -- i think we can have a lot of fun with this throughout our career and our lives

i think its so funny that the coauthor on that paper is from columbia, and i saw a picture with jason and andrea califano on twitter in like 2018 (bc i interviewed with him in 2017 and theres a possibility he reached out to jason and the same thing happened there as well bc they stopped responding to my emails), but i wonder how obsessed jason is with columbia bc he burned his bridges with you guys LOL fking LOSER


yoo it is so therapeutic to do this voicenote, these people are so utterly disgusting like as im writing along the day what happend and on their bullshit research, i dunno its just so disgusting the feelings i have about them, how much of waste of time they have been, im so glad i have u to listen to me so i can share it and make u laugh too, im just really streamlining everything i want to say, like i want it to be really good, so when i feel ready, maybe this week or next week, ill record it -- i just cant believe this is real that ppl be this pathetic to stalk a resigned employee, my talking about makes it real and that is the power of words and talking

fking trailer park TRASH

im know, im going to feel SO MUCH BETTER after i do this: explain EVERYTHING that happened, its like this weight is being removed off my shoulders bc its been set up to look like its my fault or your fault, but its not our fault, these are just psychopaths, its a freak accident. if my first job out of undergrad was at MSKCC I WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY successful there and etc, but thats not what happened, i ended up in a shithole, run by trailer park trash

i was thinking about what she said, i dunno ive seen this awhile ago, but i was thinking about it today https://www.youtube.com/shorts/UnUA4dlYcYs

yeah, i have all these emotions from like 10 yrs ago and im reliving them, going through them, im like wtf none of this penn stuff was my fault, it just wasnt, it wasnt your fault either

i have to do this, i have to do this well and im going to feel so much better, and im going to use the next few months to really figure out a bunch of stuff, like what i want to be an expert in in comp bio. i think really want to get back to my old self, like back at rutgers, where i just genuinely loved and enjoyed bioinformatics, and there was just no sadness associated with it at all, i know i can get to that point again

i wanna send you voicenotes with like random study things or like me talking about a random topic in science, lemme do this one big one, then ill get to that end of the month

these next few months -> are going to be me moving forward from the sadness of this past thats just been glued to me, like ive moved on but its being glued to me

and i have to go to the fking gym a few times a week bc that helps me too

the central theme of this upcoming voice note is: why canâ€™t jason moore ever get anything right, why is he always so consistently wrong and yet he can never just shut the fk up

how im organizing it:
1. provide empirical evidence of what happened
2. provide my informed, educated, opinion of why that happened and then whose fault it was really

ðŸ˜¬

my goal is to complete annihilate him, through my words, within the first 5-10 mins by getting to the point of not only how much of a fking loser he is, but also what his ultimate goal was

then hes going to be too afraid to hear the rest of it haha fking loser trailer trash -- gotta roll up your sleeves and put people in their place

and as im figuring everything out, like unknotting all the knots, making sense of everything, its like such a weight off my shoulders, i really have been like all these years "ohhh its in the past, it happened, whatever, ive moved on, i had better jobs, made so much money etc" but i can see as im figuring it all out, i think deep down, ive been carrying some sadness about this, of the penn stuff

theres the my not seeing you again since 2017, thats sadness sure

but i never truly addressed the sadness of why i wasnt successful there even though i had the skills and educational background to be successful at penn

now im glad it never worked out bc then i wouldnt have met you and had these other jobs in Maryland/NJ/NY that were BETTER

but it still could have been you know 2 yrs of a good experience, a clean exit, and it just never was that -- so whose fault was that, NOT MINE

i think im going to record it in my car, maybe drive to the beach and park there and have the view of the ocean, of people walking on the boardwalk and eating ice cream and ill bring some ice coffee or matcha, wear sweatpants, and a blanket, and just enjoy recording it for like 2+ hrs hahaha lol ðŸ˜‚
